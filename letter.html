                    HAPPY 2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY :D <br>
                    i'm writing this while working at coquitlam lol and tbh i've been putting off writing this section. <br>
                    i think i put this off, not becuz i don't know what to say, but rather, i don't think i'll ever feel there's a perfect way to express it...so goodluck reading this lol <br> <br> in the past, i think i've already said and written countless 
                    similar paragraphs and words to what you're about to read, and honestly i don't think there'll ever be a time where i'd get tired of doing things like this for you. <br> <br>

                    ooooo im getting nervous lol. <br>
                    as of right now (may 10), i don't quite know what to get you for our anniversary but i always knew i wanted to code a website for you. <br>
                    my plan is to send you this on our anniversary so if you're seeing this that means my plan was a success!!! woohoooooo <br> <br>

                    anyways, <br>
                    i can't believe it's already been 2 years, i always go in my photos and look back on our photos (even though we don't have a lot)
