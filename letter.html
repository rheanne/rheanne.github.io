                    HAPPY 2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY MY LOVE <3 <br>
                    it's me iya! but you probably already know that lol c: <br>
                    tbh i've been putting off writing this section. <br>
                    i think i put this off, not becuz i don't know what to say, but rather, i don't think i'll ever feel like there's a perfect way to express it...so goodluck reading this lol <br> <br> in the past, i think i've most definitely already said and written countless 
                    similar paragraphs and words to what you're about to read, and honestly i don't think there'll ever be a time where i'd get tired of doing things like this for you. <br> <br>

                    ooooo im getting nervous lol. <br>
                    as of right now (may 10), i don't quite know what to get you for our anniversary but i always knew i wanted to code a website for you. <br>
                    my plan is to send you this on our anniversary so if you're seeing this that means my plan was a success!!! woohoooooo <br> <br>
                    i hope you're surprised by this tbh. and i hope it becomes something you look at often. <br>
                    but i mean even if it isn't something you look at often, that's okay and i don't blame you lol (it's a very mid website and i hope to get better).
                    anyways, <br>
                    here we go! <br>
                    
                    when i first met you, aka our first date (where we met up at gong cha), my first impression of you wasn't that i was intimidated but rather, intrigued i guess? <br>
                    i'll always remember the first time i read the way you described me to someone, you said meeting me or myself as a person was different, and not like other girls you've ever really met. you said my honesty and my demeanor was like a "breath of fresh air". <br>
                    and although you might not even remember saying those things, it has stuck with me for the past 2 years.
